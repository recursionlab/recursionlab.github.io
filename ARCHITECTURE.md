# Architecture Notes â€” Recursion Lab

This file distills a short Architect Guide for module authors who want to design and manage whole projects.

Principles
- Encapsulate intent: module boundaries should reflect responsibilities and invariants, not only file layout.
- Standardize interfaces: use explicit, stable contracts (schemas or API specs).
- Observability from the start: logs, traces, and metrics make integration problems visible.
- Design for graceful failure: define how modules degrade and recover.
- Evolve safely: version contracts and provide deprecation paths.

Quick checklist
- One-line ownership for each module (who owns what).
- Explicit contract for each integration (inputs, outputs, errors).
- Failure modes documented and practiced.
- Integration tests in CI (contract tests and a small end-to-end smoke test).
- Observability: structured logs + a couple of business metrics for key flows.

Mini example (blog)
- Content API owns canonical content and emits `content.updated` events.
- Admin UI talks to Content API synchronously for editing flows.
- Search service subscribes to events to index content asynchronously.
- CDN serves static builds; preview mode reads content directly for staging.

Practical next steps (minimal edits you can do now)
- Add one-sentence ownership lines to module READMEs.
- Add a contract checklist entry to PR templates (if you have them).
- Ensure CI runs the Jekyll build (already present) and add a smoke test for a public route.

If you want, I can convert this into a more detailed `ARCHITECTURE.md` with diagrams, or add a small PR template and a README checklist. For now this is kept minimal so you can add your content later.
