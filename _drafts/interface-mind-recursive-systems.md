How interacting with recursive AI/systems changes the way people think.

- Cognitive reshaping, adaptation, feedback
- Case references to discuss (e.g., observation effects)

Draft notes:

- Interaction patterns (what users see, how they adapt)
- Risks (overtrust, loop amplification)
- Design implications (affordances, transparency)
