How LLMs currently do recursion (prompts, self-critique, looped tasks)

- Pitfalls & limits (hallucinations, coherence collapse)
- Best practices / experiments

Draft notes:

- Prompt patterns (plan → draft → critique → revise)
- Tooling patterns (scratchpads, checklists, verifiers)
- Metrics and failure cases
