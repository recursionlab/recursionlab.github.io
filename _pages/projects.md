## Projects

This page lists prototype ideas exploring recursive systems. Replace or expand these with your own projects as they evolve.

### Recursive Self-Reflection Engine
- Goal: Prototype a system that self-evaluates outputs, detects contradictions, and regenerates improved responses.
- Sketch: Combine a language model with lightweight symbolic rules to create a feedback loop for critique → revise → verify.
- Notes: Inspired by work on emergent recursive cognition via language-encoded symbolic systems. Add links and code when available.

### Recursive Reasoning Tools for LLMs
- Goal: Build tools or prompt frameworks that enforce recursive reasoning (multiple passes with critique and revision).
- Sketch: Design a reusable protocol (plan → draft → critique → revise) and measure quality gains on target tasks.
- Notes: Start with prompt-only approaches; evolve into lightweight libraries if useful.

### Visualization of Feedback Systems
- Goal: Create visual/interactive models of recursive systems from biology, cognition, or social domains.
- Sketch: Show how loops amplify, stabilize, and collapse; let users tweak parameters to see phase changes.
- Notes: Consider small web demos or notebooks.

### Cognitive Architecture Comparisons
- Goal: Compare architectures (e.g., CLARION and others) to locate where explicit vs. implicit recursion plays a role.
- Sketch: Build small simulations to highlight differences in learning and control loops.
- Notes: Collect references (papers, Wikipedia) and plan a minimal, comparable benchmark.
