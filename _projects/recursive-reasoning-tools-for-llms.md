summary: Tools and protocols that enforce recursive reasoning via plan → draft → critique → revise loops.

Goal: Build tools or prompt frameworks that enforce recursive reasoning (multiple passes with critique and revision).

Sketch: Design a reusable protocol (plan → draft → critique → revise) and measure quality gains on target tasks.

Notes: Start with prompt-only approaches; evolve into lightweight libraries if useful.
