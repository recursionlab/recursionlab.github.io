Goal: Prototype a system that self-evaluates outputs, detects contradictions, and regenerates improved responses.

Sketch: Combine a language model with lightweight symbolic rules to create a feedback loop for critique → revise → verify.

Notes: Inspired by work on emergent recursive cognition via language-encoded symbolic systems. Add links and code when available.
