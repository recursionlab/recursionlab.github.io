Notes:
- Jekyll build completed successfully in the dev container. Vendor Sass produced deprecation warnings (non-blocking). If you want these fixed, I can refactor local SCSS to use @use and math.div in a follow-up.
- Let me know if you'd like this QA file committed and a PR opened (I can create a branch, commit, push, and open a PR summarizing changes and build output).
