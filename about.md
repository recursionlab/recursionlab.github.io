## About

Recursion Lab is a personal research and writing project exploring recursion, cognition, and systems thinking. I collect short essays, notes, and prototypes as I work through ideas â€” sometimes exploratory, sometimes polished. 

This site is powered by Jekyll with the SparrowX theme. Use the `Blog` link to browse posts, and the `Projects` link to surface ongoing experiments.
