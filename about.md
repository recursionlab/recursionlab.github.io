## About

Recursion Lab studies the interplay of recursion, cognition, and systems. We publish public notes and working prototypes that test ideas about feedback, self‑reference, and emergent behavior.

We believe recursion is a core mechanism — in learning, in feedback, and in self‑reference. Through notes, experiments, and open-source prototypes we explore:

- How recursive architectures enable emergent cognition
- How biological, computational, and social systems stabilize via feedback loops
- What happens when recursion is applied to meaning, memory, and identity

This site is a research‑and‑prototype space. Browse the Blog for ongoing notes, and Projects for experiments you can try. Replace this paragraph with your contact or newsletter link when ready.
